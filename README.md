<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*7bnLKsChXq94QjtAiRn40w.png">

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming.
It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. 
Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine
We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Getting Started
1. You can access the raw data [here](https://github.com/ab-aruneswaran/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION/blob/main/DataSets/iris.csv) within this repo.
2. All of the scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/ab-aruneswaran/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION/blob/main/IRIS_ML_MODEL_FILE.ipynb).


### Result 

 This Machine Learning Model achieves a high accuracy of 100% using all of above Algorithms .
#### I hope this will be useful someday, thankyou for seeing !‚úåüèª
